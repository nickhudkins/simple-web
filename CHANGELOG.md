# 0.3.0 (Mr. Goodbar)
**New Features**

Version `0.3.0` is an exciting release. It's been a long time coming, but
we have added `docker` && `docker-compose` into the mix. This means you can
deploy this to places! It's for you to figure out where you want to do it but...
I have provided a small guide in `README.md` to get you started on Digital Ocean.

# 0.2.0 (York Peppermint Pattie)

**New Features**
- Server Side Rendering!

**Additional Notes**

In `0.2.0` we have removed redux-devtools temporarily
while waiting for `3.0.0` to become stable. If you really
want to run `3.0.0-beta3` have at it, we will not be supporting it.

We have also version locked many dependencies in an attempt to provide
the most stable platform we can. :+1:

Several dependencies have been updated and the use of `npm@3.3.2`
has been adopted to make everyone's lives better.

# 0.1.0 (Almond Joy)
**General**

In `0.1.0` I released a terrific project that I plan on supporting for as long as I do web development. It is a place where I will form my opinions on best practices, and more.
